# About this project
Genshin Damage Calculator is a tool aimed to visualize the damage number dealt by characters in Genshin Impact. This project is built in the angular framework.About Genshin Damage 
As this is a tool to cater to every character in the game, it is difficult to develop all characters at once. So I have decided to develop character additions in batches of 4. Currently the only available characters are Amber, Barbara, Bennett and Beidou. More additions will be made with each version.

# Why this project?
Although there are several great damage calculators for Genshin Impact online , it is still difficult to use them to build up a character in Genshin Impact . Many people who do not want to consider every possible scenario would prefer a simple damage output based on their current stats. This app focuses on simplicity for the use of casual genshin impact players.

# What is the Genshin Damage Calculator used for

## For:
* Comparing between different character builds as well as theorycrafting
* Having a better understanding of how damage build up in Genshin impact
* Maximizing your damage in certain situations

## Not For (currently):
* Calculation on a period of time(DPS calculation)
